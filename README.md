# RubyConf Minsk 2018

All code and scripts I use to make a presentation are here. Hope they will save your time and be useful!

## Getting Started

I think you have everything to start. Just in case, install `ruby` using [rvm](https://rvm.io)

### Prerequisites

Use the bunlder we love (again, just in case, `gem install bundler`)

```
bundle
```
